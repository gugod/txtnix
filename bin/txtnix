=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<txtnix> is a client for the decentralised, minimalist microblogging
service for hackers L<https://github.com/buckket/twtxt>.

Until i find the time to write some documentation,
you should check the very good documentation over at
I<http://twtxt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>. Although i don't
plan to reimplement every feature identically, the configuration options
and commands should behave very similar at the moment.
